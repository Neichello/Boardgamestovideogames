  <h1 id="history">The History </h1>
  <p> Gaming goes back a long way. People presume that ‘Senet’ is the first one,<br>
    dating back to 3500 B.C. and it was played by people in Ancient Rome. <br>Since then,
    many, many games have released and improved progressively <br>over time. And with technology
    for video games being released in 1958, it made a gateway for Board Games to be converted
    to Video Games. In 1977, <br>a Blackjack game was made for the Atari 2600, by ‘Bob Whitehead’.
    <br>This release is the first game converted to video games that I can find.<br>
<br>
Bob Whitehead used to make games for the Atari 2600, the first one being <br>‘Starship’, he made many
board game conversions throughout his time <br>making games. The first conversion he made was ‘Blackjack’,
and it’s <br>just what it sounds like; Blackjack. The 2 other conversions he made were <br>‘Casino’ and ‘Video Chess’.
Eventually he went on to make games for the <br>Commodore 64, and he hasn’t made games since. </p>

  <p> Nowadays, there is a conversion for just about any Board Game you can<br> think of to Video Games.
     Popular games like Monopoly, Risk, Solitaire, <br>Chess, Checkers and many more are in video game form.
       I believe <br>a good example of Board Games to video games is risk. With websites<br> like Landgrab giving
        you the opportunity to play Risk in any way you <br>want, however many people you want, make any map
         you want, and play<br> with any rules on or off, is a great upgrade to the board game of risk.<br>
<br>
Another great example of board games to video games is Chess, <br>Not only can you play with anybody in the world,
 it includes tutorials for <br>just about any situation in the game, different game modes, it tells you <br>if you did
 good or bad and where you can improve. Overall the definitive <br>way of playing Chess, all because of its conversion to video games. </p>
